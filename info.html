<p class="info">When I first started making the game, I had planned for it to be a military themed <b>nuclear weapons testing</b> facility, much like <b>Nuclear Bomb Testing Facility</b> by <b>RyanBlaze</b>.
Then, my old friend contacted me wanting to build a Soviet Union game. I said yes, but it failed due to disagreements about leadership, building, map layout, etc. So I took my other military game and 
made it into a TSU. I began recruiting people and got <b>Cookie_President123</b> to join the army. They are the very first member of the Armed Forces, and shortly got invited to the Premier's Family. 
Then, I brought in a Deputy Premier, <b>Anumber6LargePlease</b>. He became a developer and has been a huge help in the game. He made the following:</p>

<p class="info">Jail</p>
<p class="info">Reactor Containment Room</p>
<p class="info">Reactor Control Room</p>
<p class="info">Bank</p>
<p class="info">Most of the city</p>

<p class="info">More information will come as the game grows!</p>
