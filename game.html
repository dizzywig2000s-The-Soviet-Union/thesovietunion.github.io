<p class="info">The original game project for <b>The Soviet Border</b> was a test game named "<b>In development.</b>". I had created it
as a nuclear test site, but then made it into a border. It has come far from its original purpose, and even gaining a community. About
R$8,000 (8,000 Robux) has been spent on it, mostly for groups and ranks. Click <a class="plink" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7473711315/The-Soviet-Border">here</a> to play the Roblox game.
You can also find limited, holiday, seasonal, and event related gamepasses <a class="plink" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7886143818/Extra-Gamepasses">here</a>.</p>
